        <h4>Who We Are</h4>
        <p>
            K-Electric (KE) energizing Karachi for over one hundred years. Through a network spanning across 6,500 square kilometres, KE supplies power to all residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural areas that fall under the city’s ambit and beyond, serving over 3.4 million customers across Karachi, Dhabeji and Gharo in Sindh, and Uthal, Vinder and Bela in Balochistan.
        
        KE is the only vertically-integrated power utility in Pakistan, which means the organisation manages all three key areas – Generation, Transmission and Distribution – of producing and delivering energy to consumers.

        <p>Formerly known as Karachi Electric Supply Company Limited, the power utility is an integral part of one of the world’s most populous cities. In 2009, KES Power Limited, the majority shareholder of KE, put into place a turnaround strategy which has seen investments of over USD 4.1 billion. These have resulted in 1,057 MW being added to the company’s Generation capacity and Transmission & Distribution capacity has been increased by approximately 29% and 60% respectively, followed by a 15.5% point reduction in Transmission & Distribution losses. K-Electric’s transformation is a globally recognised success story of business excellence.
        
            KE is proud to be one of the most dynamic institutions in the country and the organisation aspires to continuously serve Karachi with even greater vigour and purpose with the collective support of all its stakeholders.</p>
